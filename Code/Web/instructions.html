        <p class="instr"> Pipelayer is a two player game where each player creates lines using different shaped icons. The game is played with two grids of icons that are slightly offset from one another. One player utilizes the circles and the other uses the squares.
            The players take turns moving by connecting two of their respective icons to an adjacent icon. A player can only connect icons that are adjacent horizontally or vertically and also only icons of their own shape. No move may draw across another
            move. To win, a player must make a continuous connection from one side of the board to the other in the long direction for their color of dots. The player with the circles wins if they create a continuous vertical line from the top of the
            game board to the bottom, while the player with the squares wins if they make a continuous line from the left to the right.</p>
